====================

RadioVis Player using WebSocket

## General architecture

The system is divided in two part: The server and the client. The server is a simple process running on any machine and the client a set of javascript/css files to be included in any part. You can use them in any setup, no PHP or other dynamic web server is needed.

## Installation

### Server

The websocket server is located in websocketserver. To run it, just use `python server.py`. It's possible to change the listening port and ip at the beginning of the file.

The websocket server is written in python. He needs the following packages:

* ws4py==0.3.0-beta
* gevent
* dnspython
* python-statsd (BSD license)

You can use `pip install ws4py==0.3.0-beta gevent dnspython python-statsd ` to install them.


The server use statsd to send some stats about the number of connections. You can setup a local statsd server to collect them.

### Client

The client part include a javascript file (_radiovis-html5player.js_) and a css file (_radiovis-html5player.css_). You have to include jquery first.

You can use `$('#an_id').radiovisplayer('/topic/bla/bla', ip, port);` to load the player inside a DOM element. The optional parameters ip and port can be used to override defaults parameters (the current host and 8777) to the websocket server.

The file _index.html_ contains a sample implementation.
