====================

RadioVis Player using WebSocket

## General architecture

The system is divided in two part: The server and the client. The server is a simple process running on any machine and the client a set of javascript/css files to be included in any part. You can use them in any setup, no PHP or other dynamic web server is needed.

## Installation

### Server

The websocket server is located in websocketserver. To run it, just use `python server.py`. It's possible to change the listening port and ip at the beginning of the file.

The websocket server is written in python. He needs the following packages:

* ws4py==0.3.0-beta
* gevent
* dnspython
* python-statsd (BSD license)) (Temporarly disabled)

You can use `pip install ws4py==0.3.0-beta gevent dnspython python-statsd ` to install them.


(DISABLED) The server use statsd to send some stats about the number of connections. You can setup a local statsd server to collect them.

### Client

The client part include a javascript file (_radiovis-html5player.js_) and a css file (_style.css_).

You can use `<vis-frame topic="/topic/bla/bla">` to add a new frame with a dedicated websocket connection to the python server. The (optional) attributes `ip` and `port` can be used to override the default attribute values (ip = localhost, port = 8777) for the websocket server connection. 

The file _index.html_ contains a sample implementation.
